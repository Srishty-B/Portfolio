   <p>Hi! I'm Srishty and this is my story :<br>

   it all started when I made my first drawing ever :<br>
   you may know who this character is :)<br>

   then it just went on and on and I struggled to find a career in art ,<br> 
   my parents wanted me to opt a scientific field since I got good grades <br>
   in my school(10 CGPA in tenth), I liked science too! <br>
   but I struggled throughout my engineering as I really wanted to do<br>
   something in art , then I discovered web development , and every <br>
   doubt I had regarding my career vanished ^_^ , I knew this was <br>
   the best career for me and this is what I was born to do :D</p>
